This project implements two methods;

 (**Item Average Rating, Item Absolute Likeability**) in journal 

**Improving Recommendation Diversity Using Ranking-Based Techniques** (by Gediminas Adomavicius and YoungOk Kwon) 

at **http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/Diversity-Aug2009.pdf**

And we propose a new method (**Rating Maniplation**) in order to increase aggregate diversity of recommenders. 

We measure these three methods with different measures such as gini, herf, entropy.


More over we find a faster way than **Apache Mahout** to evaluate recommenders.

**Technologies;**
**Apache Mahout**
